Folder muokatut contains some 3D models that I have modified. 
-NOVA SM3 Assembly_SM3_Frame_RightTibia muokattu <-- modified tibia for the robot, attachment point for  the servo is changed to better fit the servomotors used.
-cover_updated_for_Chris_Shoulder_muokattu v4 <-- modified the bearing holes to fit the bearings I used.
-SM3_Frame_FrontShoulderOuter paksunnettu <-- part is made thicker and bearing holes deeper to work with the modified frame.
-SM3_Frame_RearShoulderMiddle Paksunnettu levy <-- same as above.
-robottikoiran jetson runko v4 <-- modified main frame part for the robot. It is made to have room for jetson nano and the components in the original design.
-Assembly_Cover_HeadPanel kamera upotus v8 <-- modified the head part so that it has mounting for IMX219-83 Stereo Camera.
-Ass - Speaker v5 v1 <-- is modified so that it fits to the new shoulder frame parts.

Original design can be found from here:
https://github.com/cguweb-com/Arduino-Projects/tree/main/Nova-SM3

Code is python version of the code that is eventually going to be in the robot. 

Python version works as a simulator for the behavior, so it would be easyer to implement new code with out breaking anything.
