Code and the documentation pdf contain spelling errors.<br>
Comments in code are partly in english and partly in finnish.<br>

Other than that the simulator works as its supposed to.<br>


Folder muokatut contains some 3D models that I have modified. <br>
-NOVA SM3 Assembly_SM3_Frame_RightTibia muokattu <-- modified tibia for the robot, attachment point for  the servo is changed to better fit the servomotors used.<br>
-cover_updated_for_Chris_Shoulder_muokattu v4 <-- modified the bearing holes to fit the bearings I used.<br>
-SM3_Frame_FrontShoulderOuter paksunnettu <-- part is made thicker and bearing holes deeper to work with the modified frame.<br>
-SM3_Frame_RearShoulderMiddle Paksunnettu levy <-- same as above.<br>
-robottikoiran jetson runko v4 <-- modified main frame part for the robot. It is made to have room for jetson nano and the components in the original design.<br>
-Assembly_Cover_HeadPanel kamera upotus v8 <-- modified the head part so that it has mounting for IMX219-83 Stereo Camera.<br>
-Ass - Speaker v5 v1 <-- is modified so that it fits to the new shoulder frame parts.<br>
-tassumuotti <- mold for casting the paws from silicone

Original design can be found from here:<br>

Code is python version of the code that is eventually going to be in the robot. <br>

Python version works as a simulator for the behavior, so it would be easyer to implement new code with out breaking anything.<br>
